## About

The memory game presents the first opportunity to fully combine my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript DOM manipulation to build a complete browser-based card matching game (also known as Concentration).

## How to play

Download the folder contents and open the index.html file

**Steps to play the game**
1. Click on any card.
2. A card reveales its icon to you, then click on a second card to reveal its icon.
3. If the first card clicked by you matches its icon with the second card clicked; you get a match.
4. If the both card icons don't match, they are hidden back and you start over steps 1, 2 & 3 again.
5. When total 8 pairs of card are matched, you win.
6. Your no of moves taken to achieve above steps will determine your final star rating.
7. You can restart the game by clicking on the reload icon.

    *For higher star rating,match cards with less moves in lesser time.
    Good luck!*
